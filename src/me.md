This is a beautiful quote from a [presentation][2] by Jon Sterling.

I am fascinated by PL theory, type theory, and the idea of the
[computational trilogy][1], and this informs how I think about my work as a
professional software developer.

My goal is to pull useful abstractions from the fields of logic, philosophy,
ethics, and artificial intelligence (at least in my particular niche as a
research engineer) and make them available both to my colleagues at work as well
as to interested others in the open source and general public.

Hopefully, the decision to publish both my raw and refined thoughts via this
`mdbook` will help motivate me to keep articulating, editing, and learning
indefinitely.
