## Challenges

- [x] Challenge 1: Echo

This challenge had us configure a client which met the basic `maelstrom` test
framework spec. My implementation is more or less identical to Jon's, although I
have some additional boilerplate to extend the CLI interface using `clap`, if
needed.

- [ ] Challenge 2: Unique ID Generation
- [ ] Challenge 3: Broadcast
