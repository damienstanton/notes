## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Damien

This is a loosely collected set of notes on computer science and
related/applicable fields of study.

They are typically **quite raw** and only for my own personal use, except for
posts in the [editorials](./editorials.md) section, which are intended as blog
posts for public consumption.
