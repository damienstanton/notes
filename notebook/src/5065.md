## EMEA 5065: The neuroscience of leading high-performance teams

**Desires**

- Finances and work
- Relationships
- Health
- Recreation
- Moral, ethical, and spiritual

**Greed**

- Stimulates motivation centers in the brain (more one has, ++ rewards one
  seeks)
- E.g. sharing accumulated wealth with others often leads to greater emotional
  satisfaction
- Brain evolved to anticipate extreme scarcity, we need to actively retrain to
  anticipate abundance

**Two forms of desire**

1. Unconscious drive to survive (bottom-up)
2. Conscious wanting by optimistic fantasies about the future (top-down)
   “wishful seeing” <- what we want to tap into in teams. “Breadcrumb” model for
   long-term driving of goals.

**Dopamine control circuit**

- Manage uncontrolled urges of dopamine desire
- Guides “raw energy” towards profitable ends
- Abstract concepts and forward-looking strategies
- Imagination
- Control of world

Desire circuit vs control circuit

- Phantoms: things we wish to have
- Phantoms: building blocks of imagination, creative thought

- Motivation and persistence
  - Cost-benefit tradeoffs
  - Celebrating small wins
- "I don't care anymore; I need to stop for good and call it a day" vs "I'm
  going to take a short break and regroup by focusing on why achieving this goal
  matters to me and keep going”

Dopaminergic circuitry responds _not_ to reward or pleasure, but to reward
_prediction error_

$R_\text{actual} - R_\text{expected}$

- Keeping expectations low can maximize the delta between actual and expected
  rewards
- Think about this w.r.t. goal setting, and how to discretize tasks
- Anticipation, reward prediciton error, novelty, and curiosity drive motivation
- Pain and fear diminish motivation, but drive growth and learning (push through
  to harder goals)

**Barriers to motivation**

- Physical pain
- Unpleasant emotional experiences
- Ruminating on unpleasant thoughts

Time boxing is a technique to properly process negative experiences (small
mourning) - even 90 seconds.

**Distant goals and desires (future oriented)**

"Time to hunt vs time to eat"

- Switch transition from forward-oriented dopamine (wanting) to present-oriented
  (H&N) dopamine.

- Pursue hard, long-term goals

- Dopaminergic personality
  - Bored easily
  - Enjoys anticipation and planning more than doing
  - Easily distracted
  - Loves thrill of chase > prize

- Dopamine fasting (trendy take on asceticism) has some validity but shouldn't
  be taken to extremes. Fasting, of any kind, can be addictive.

- Ocytocin
  - Associated initially with sex & breastfeeding
  - Synthesized by the brain when needed, short half-life (~ 3 minutes)
  - Ocytocin in analogy to dopamine is not a "trust hormone", but rather
    _anticipation of trustworthiness_.

**What is engagement?**

Activates the prefrontal cortex, provides a sense of empowerment and motivation,
activates areas of the brain involved in reflection and introspection, driving
fulfillment and satisfaction.

- Engagement must utilize the social interfaces wired into the brain
  - Reward systems
  - Trust systems
    - Sense of autonomy and control over one's work, decision-making
    - Sense of meaning and purpose; serving a larger mission

**Social brain and compassion**

- Insula (sensorimotor processing, sense of self) and anterior cingulate cortex
  (threat-processing, pain or suffering)
  - Helps connect the goal-seeking desires of the prefrontal-cortex with the
    interroceptive centers (amygdala, limbic areas)
  - Drives our ability to feel compassion and guilt

**SCARF model**

- Status
- Certainty
- Autonomy
- Relatedness (ingroup/outgroup)
- Fairness

**General ideas**

- Be mindful of instance labels
- Find and work with "chemistry creators"
