Consider this beautiful quote from a [presentation][2] by Jon Sterling:

> Tension lies between notions of _abstraction_ and _composition_

> - Composition (which embodies harmony)

> PL theory is "advancing linguistic solutions to the contradiction between

I am fascinated by PL theory, type theory, and the idea of the
[computational trilogy][1]. These ideas are worth thinking about, and worth sharing.

My independent research while a part-time graduate student is in the study of the intersection of three topics.

1. Formal modeling of autonomous systems & AI models.
2. Distributed systems & type theory.
3. Robotics & embedded systems.

A rough collection of raw notes and presentable pieces, I hope this kind of "living book" will motivate me to keep articulating, editing, and learning indefinitely.
